## Mini Project

Submission for a CSC207-02 2024Fa project on associative arrays.
This code was submitted on 30 September, 2024.

An updated code repository may be found at Andrew's GitHub: 
[https://github.com/andrewfargo/mp-associative-arrays-maven], 
which itself is a fork of the provided code written by Sam:
[https://github.com/Grinnell-CSC207/mp-associative-arrays-maven].

The assignment specification may be found at this link:
[https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC207/2024Fa/mps/mp04.html].

## Running

This code composes a small Java library that implements associative
arrays, i.e. Key/Value pair lists that operates in linear time.

To use the data type, you may import
`edu.grinnell.csc207.util.AssociativeArray` into your program. This
code also contains experiments and tests with the data type; the
experiments may be found in
`edu.grinnell.csc207.experiments.AAExperiments`, the tests in the
`src/test` directory.

NB: this project is accompanied by tests written by both sections of
the course. These are not located within the repository, nor should
they be. These tests are intended to be placed in
`edu.grinnel.csc207.shared`
and may be located at this repository:

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to Sam Rebelsky for providing the original code,
and to members of the 2024Fa sections of CSC207 for providing
tests. All code was written where attributed or by `git blame`; no
resources were consulted outside that which was learned in class or
the assignment specification.
